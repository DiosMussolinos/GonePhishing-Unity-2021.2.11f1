Please, try to follow this organization. Scene One, your code your rules.

This organization was used in my internship, and in my old job.
GameObjects have a max of 4"="'s

The more '=', the more important it is. If an GameObject is being repetitive or can fulfill a specific organization, add a new one.
Sorry to be a pain up your ass, but this is really helpful.
