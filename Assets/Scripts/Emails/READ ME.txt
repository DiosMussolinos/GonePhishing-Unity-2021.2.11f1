Emails have a pretty simple struture.

But, to work at its finest, YOU NEED to add an unique ID. This must happen on each Person/Day.
IDs can repeat IF they are not in the same Person/Day.

If the email is a Phishing one, SELECT the boolean as true when creating. 
This boolean is used to verify in an optimal way which should do.

If you have any question, Send me a message. 
I tried to make this code as simple, and as organized as I could.
